## Trystup?
Trystup is a markup language for expressing the content of lines in Trystal.net and associated applications.

## Features?
The language is perhaps closest in format to MarkDown; it is designed to be fairly simple and compact but still support formatting, 
links, and fields, but optimized for use in the large scale trists that can comprise a Trystal document.
